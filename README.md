Tableau for Data Mining

This repository contains 2 datasets - OfficeSupplies.csv and ChurnModelling.xlsx - and uses Tableau to analyze data to determine relationship between various data attributes and the outcomes as well as visualize these relationships. Each folder in the repository corresponds to a dataset and data mining on that dataset. Within each folder you'll find the dataset itself, a notepad file contianing the description of that dataset along with steps to follow to perform data mining, a twb file (Tableau Workbook) containing the Tableau results that can be directly imported to Tableau and a PowerPoint file containing these results.
